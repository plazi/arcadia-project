## Activities

## Metadata
In this workflow (Accession), the title, authors, abstract, keywords, PIDs (DOI, ISSN, etc.), journal, publication date (year), and copyrights are added. 
The OCR is captured normally, and we only need to edit typographical errors or accents.

## Treatments
In this workflow (Treatments), treatments and subSubSections are added, the latter being divided into nomenclature and multiple. 
The continuation of a treatment or subSubSection is indicated by the repetition of the same treatment or subSubSection number in the annotations made on the following pages. 
There is no OCR capture.

## Taxonomic names
In this workflow (still under Treatments), the taxonomic names of the target taxa of each treatment are added. 
The annotation of the taxonomic name is included within a nomenclature subSubSection annotation. 
The OCR is captured but not recognized, so all taxonomic names must be included manually.

## Material citations
There is no workflow ready yet
