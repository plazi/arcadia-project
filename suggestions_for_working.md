## Suggestions for Working
@punkish 2019-06-19

### 1. When discussing a technical issue, please open a Github issue, somewhere, anywhere, on a [Plazi repo](https://github.com/plazi/) or your own repo, I don’t care where, but on github, so it can be tracked.

1a. Though Github is the best for tracking, it is also ok to use Google Docs. Please try not to use email threads for attaching files and pursuing convoluted issues. It gets confusing. If using Google Docs, please use “suggest” mode when responding or commenting. Put your files somewhere (Google Drive) and share and link to them in your issue or email.

 1b. If something has been discussed on Skype, WhatsApp, Telegram, Gitter or even email, please convert it to a Github issue. Referring to “that Skype conversation we had” is not very efficient.

### 2. Now, this is very impt., please keep one issue to *just one issue*, as focused as possible.
   
   Do not mix more than one issues into one issue. It gets very confusing otherwise. This applies to email threads as well. Keep one email thread to one topic, and please don’t hijack an email threat, that is, reuse an existing thread for a new topic. Start a new topic in a new email. But best, use a github issue. <span id="a1">[[1]](#f1)</span>

### 3. Don’t give up if your suggestion is not immediately used/applied/implemented. Keep at it until it is rejected or accepted by others.
   
Remember, it is a suggestion, not a command, so it is entirely possible that it will be rejected. Don’t be disheartened. That is the nature of collective working. But if you really think it is impt., do bring it up again, and keep at it.

### 4. Please try to give ample heads-up time to respond to an issue.
   
I realize, there will be occasions when something is needed “yesterday,” but let us try not to use up our emergency-response-quota unless really needed. Many of us are, as noted above, working on several projects, and may be in very different timezones than you. It may not be possible always to respond immediately without considerable difficulty.

#### Footnotes
=========

1. <span id="f1"></span> This if you reply to an email but delete the contents and the subject, it still doesn’t create a new thread because most email programs use an internal email message ID (kinda like a GUID) to track emails and their threading. To create a new topic, literally create a new email.
