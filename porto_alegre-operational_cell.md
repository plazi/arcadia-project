## Co-working Space

The idea is to have one office where we can all work together in an attempt of enhancing productivity, which might be hamper, with a home office strategy.

## Equipments

The idea is to at least provide two monitors per person, as the template making require look to multiple PDFs at once. 

## Sallary

The estimate sallary is a little bit above the current value of PhD fellowships in Brazil, as we're targetting recent PhDs with expertise in taxonomy. Current PhD fellowship would be R$2.200,00 (or ~ 500,00 euros).

## People Selection

I'm trying to follow these criteria in order to find people:

1. Expertise in taxonomy, preferably at PhD level
2. Can get around software, doesn't struggle with technology
3. Can speak English
4. Lives in Porto Alegre
5. Interested in data/mission
